# JavaSpringBoot-Angular-App

This is an app where users can manage servers they can access locally. A user can ping the server to see if the server is up and monitor its status. 

However, this project only works if a user actually has servers with those specific IP addresses running. Using API links for health checks rather than server IP addresses for pinging could be a more versatile app that can be explored. Adding user authentication and implementing Spring Security is another exploration.
